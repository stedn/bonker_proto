<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">At a few recent parties with coworkers from <a href="http://munrolab.bsd.uchicago.edu/">my lab</a> and from <a href="http://blog.artificechicago.org/">my non-profit</a>, I've been playing a modified role-playing version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_%28party_game%29">classic werewolf/mafia party game</a>.  It's been really fun and also really interesting trying to build.  <h4>The setup</h4> <h4>The characters</h4> <h4>How the characters responded</h4><h6>First draft</h6><h6>Second draft</h6><br /></div>
