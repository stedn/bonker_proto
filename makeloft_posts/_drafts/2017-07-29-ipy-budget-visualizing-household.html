<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><p>My partner and I have been tracking our finances ever since we moved in together back in 2014.  Originally, we started just tracking our shared expenses like rent and groceries in order to make it easier to divide our household contributions <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ru/the_bedrock_of_fairness/">fairly*</a>. We wanted to build a reasonable way to redistribute our income without giving up full autonomy over our expenses. To read more about the principles behind this, you can check out the post we wrote about our Marriage Constitution.  </p>  <p>Figuring out how much we each owed was easy when Claire and I earned the same graduate student stipend and lived in the same place, but now that we have time varying incomes and a more complex expense structure, it is starting to get tricky to sort out who owes what.  Since things are getting a little more complicated, I came up with a more sophisticated way to track and visualize how much we earn and spend. I ended up writing this analysis code into a simple <a href="http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html">jupyter notebook</a> along with a python API for refreshing the data from our records on Google Sheets.  </p> <p>The code is available on the <a href="https://github.com/lots-of-things/ipy-budget">lots-of-things GitHub</a>, and I made some dummy budget data on Google Sheets.  Read on for more details and background.</p> <h4>Overview of expenses and income</h4>  <p>Over time, we started incorporating more detailed categorization to bin the .</p>   <h4>Calculating the expenses split</h4>  <h4>Securely querying Google Sheets data in python</h4> <h4></h4> <br /></div>
