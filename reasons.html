    We are living in the most frivolous and ironic century, but we can change that. Join in a fight for sincerity. You deserve a better "About me" page.

    Below, I've summarized my views on what makes up my self, my belief in a purpose of existence, and how I decide how I should act.  In some ways, it boils down to a lengthy metaphysical argument for "follow your heart," but that is at least a start. I hope you can appreciate this effort, and that you consider articulating the reasons that motivate you too.

<h5>My identity is composite and continuous</h5>

<p>
    When I say "me" I'm not talking about an atomic individual or a subjective internal mind. When I say "me," I mean a <a href="/2020/05/redefining-identity/">continuum of fields of information</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<h5>I believe the universe has a purpose</h5>

<p>
    I have derived a <a href="/2019/10/sub-identity-suicide/">thought experiment</a> that, taken with a few reasonable premises, has led me to the conclusion that the universe has a purpose.
</p>
<hr>
<h5>I believe my actions should aim to help the universe fulfill its purpose</h5>

<p>
    Importantly, just because I accept that the universe has a purpose, this doesn't mean that I know this purpose.  However, using <a href="/2020/05/philosophical-grind/">another thought experiment</a>, I've concluded that I should still assume that there is some way to ascertain the actions necessary to aid with the purpose of the universe.

<hr>
<h5>I optimize my decisions over a multitude of intuitions</h5>

<p>
    My intuitions are composite, impermanent, and hard to pin down, and yet they are all that's able to tell me what to do. I can never clearly know what is best to do so I can only choose my actions from an <a href="/2020/05/intuition-probability/">immeasurable probabilistic function</a>.
</p>

<p>
    So this is what I do.
</p>

<p>
    What do you do?
