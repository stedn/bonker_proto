	<em>We are living in what might be the most frivolous and ironic of times, but we can change that. Join in a fight for sincerity. We deserve a better "About" page.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Below I've laid out my sincere reasons for being Here. I've articulated my views on what makes up my self, the purpose of existing, and how I should act. I hope you can appreciate this effort, and that you consider your reasons that motivate you too.
</p>

    Because "because reasons" isn't reason enough for me anymore.

<h4>My identity is composite and continuous</h4>

<p>
    When I say "me" I'm not talking about an atomic individual or a subjective internal mind. When I say "me," I mean an amorphous continuum of streams of information, a collection of inputs, the state of an information transforming machine, and all of its outputs.
</p>

<h4>I must believe the universe has a purpose</h4>

<p>
    I have derived a thought experiment that, taken with a few premises, leads to the belief that the universe has a purpose.  I satisfy those premises, and so I believe the universe has a purpose.
</p>

<h4>The proper course of action must come from intuition</h4>

<p>
    Importantly, just because I accept that the universe has a purpose, this doesn't mean that I know it's purpose.  Without knowing the purpose, I cannot derive a clear course of action to achieve the purpose. Again, using another thought experiment, I've concluded that I must follow my intuitions as to what is the correct course of action to help achieve the purpose of the universe.
</p>


<h4>I can only optimizing over a multitude of intuitions</h4>

<p>
    My intuitions are composite, impermanent, and hard to pin down, and yet they are all that's left to tell me what to do. I can never clearly know what is best to do so I can only choose my actions from an expansive probabilistic function that I will never be able to know with certainty.
</p>

<p>
    So this is what I do.
</p>

<p>
    What do you do?
