    We are living in the most frivolous and ironic century, but we can change that. Join in a fight for sincerity. You deserve a better "About me" page.

    Below, I've summarized my views on what makes up my self, my belief in a purpose of existence, and how I decide how I should act.  I hope you can appreciate this effort, and that you consider the reasons that motivate you too.
</p>
<hr>
<h5>My identity is composite and continuous</h5>

<p>
    When I say "me" I'm not talking about an atomic individual or a subjective internal mind. When I say "me," I mean a <a href="/2020/05/redefining-identity/">continuum of streams of information</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>I must believe the universe has a purpose</h4>

<p>
    I have derived a <a href="/2019/10/sub-identity-suicide/">thought experiment</a> that, taken with a few reasonable premises, has led me to the conclusion that the universe has a purpose.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>The proper course of action must come from intuition</h4>

<p>
    Importantly, just because I accept that the universe has a purpose, this doesn't mean that I know this purpose.  Without knowing the purpose, I cannot derive a clear course of action to achieve the purpose. Using <a href="">another thought experiment</a>, I've concluded that the only method of ascertaining ethical action must follow from revealed intuition.
</p>

<hr>
<h4>I optimize over a multitude of intuitions</h4>

<p>
    My intuitions are composite, impermanent, and hard to pin down, and yet they are all that's left to tell me what to do. I can never clearly know what is best to do so I can only choose my actions from an <a href="">inmeasurable probabilistic function</a> that I will never be able to know with certainty.
</p>

<p>
    So this is what I do.
</p>

<p>
    What do you do?
