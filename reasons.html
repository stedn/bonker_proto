    What's the point of a personal website anyway? I pursue the experience and the creation of many things that I believe have value. But it's reasonable to ask, "Why bother?"

<h3>Why a bonkerfield?</h3>
<p>
	Bonkerfield is a word I use to describe any information-identity spacetime field.  I use the word mostly because the idea makes me sound as crazy as the

<h4>So you mean memes?</h4>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">Memes</a> are a subtype of information unit, specifically cultural phenomena residing in the minds of humans and passed on by imitation. I wanted to regard all types of information flow, which would include non-memetic things like genes, pheromone trails, or the stitching pattern of a fabric.

<h3>Some examples</h3>

    Once you begin to imagine information-identities existing in 4D spacetime, it's hard not to start thinking of the whole world in terms of this construct.

    This site is my best attempt to catalog the information-entity known as Will Stedden. It obviously has short-comings; it doesn't even begin to capture <em>every</em> antecedent, and it's clearly an editorialization of only the information outflow that I choose to showcase. But, I have a feeling that someday, essentially all of the information preserved will be recorded in our collective electronic databases.

    I was trying to think of a good word for the information-identity spacetime field, and I realized it was probably the craziest thing I've ever imagined. And then, I realized that a bonkerfield should be some kind of field anyway.
