title: Help build the Quantum Multiverse Bifurcator!
description: Lets tear a hole in Burning Man's spacetime continuum
---

<p>
	Some friends and I are currenly working on a large scale project that we're trying to bring to Black Rock City this summer. We're building a functional quantum physics apparatus that engages the Multiverse and splits participants along separate parallel realities.  If that isn't enough of a mind-warp, the machine opens a gate to one of two unique mazes through the Multiverse for any brave interdimensional being to explore.

	Check out this video and read on to see the project and what we need to help us buid it.

<p>We expect this project to both challenge burners' minds and generate an intensely engaging experience.  On the flip side, doing something so unconventional makes the work that much more difficult.  That means we need as much help as we can get trying to pull this off.</p>

<h4>Ways you can help!</h4>
<p></p>

<p>
	Like everything we do, we're trying to accomplish this with minimal waste on a miniscule budget.  Still, there are some things only money can buy. If you can help, we'd appreciate if you can make a donation .  If you donate at least $50 and <span class="popup__open" style="border-bottom: 0.25px solid $color-grey">send me an email <i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></span>, I will personally make you one of the QMB prototypes like the one featured in the video.

<h5>Other ways to help</h5>
<p>
	If you can't afford to give cash bucks, we can use a lot of different materials too.  Most of what we need is basically junk anyway, but it takes a lot of effort to collect it.  We need used tents, tarps, LED strands, scrap metal and electronics goods.  We also need a <em>ton</em> of destroyed bike tubes.  And if you have a Gieger counter lying around we could use a couple of those too. :)</p>

<p>We have a detailed item list that you can view here if you'd lilke to contribute something</p>


<h5>Learn more about progress on the project</h5>

	I will be continually updating this page as we make progress.  If you're interested to follow our work you can check out these links.
