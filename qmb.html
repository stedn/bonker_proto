title: Help us build the Quantum Multiverse Bifurcator!
description: Lets tear a hole in Burning Man's spacetime continuum
---

<p>
	Some friends and I are currenly working on a large scale project that we're trying to bring to Black Rock City this summer. We're building a functional quantum physics apparatus that engages the Multiverse and splits participants lives along separate parallel realities.  If that isn't enough of a mind-warp, the machine opens a gate to one of two unique portals through the Multiverse for any brave interdimensional being to explore.
</p>

<p>
	Check out this video and read on to see the project and what we need to help us buid it.

<p>
	We expect this project to both challenge burners' minds and generate an intensely engaging experience.  We took an early version of <a href="/2019/10/23/qmb-installation/">our installation</a> with us to SF Decompression, and we were blown away at the response. Burners love to play dice with the universe. Some people asked our machine whether they should marry their partner, and some asked whether they should sleep with the date they brought.  If you have something you're trying to decide on, you can use our online prototype to <a href="http://quantum-multiverse-bifurcator.appspot.com/">try yourself</a>.
</p>
<p>
	There's really no better place in the world to debut a radical scifi-philosophy-puzzle art installation than at Burning Man.  And since what we're building is different than any other art on Playa, we expect to have a major impact on how BRC is experienced this year.  On the flip side, doing something so unconventional makes the work that much more difficult.  That means we need as much help as we can get trying to pull this off.
</p>

<h4>Ways you can help</h4>
<p>If you think this project is worthwhile, there are a number of ways to get involved and make it a reality.</p>

<h5>Acquiring equipment</h5>
<p>
	Like everything we do, we're trying to accomplish this with minimal waste on a miniscule budget.  Still, there are some things only money can buy. If you can help, we'd appreciate if you can make a donation.  This is an entirely volunteer run effort, and every penny we make is going into materials, equipment and transportation. As always, every little bit helps. $10 could buy 15 feet of LED lighting and help our installation to be visible at night.  Below we have a parts list that includes exactly what we'll be buying with all the money we raise.  
</p>
<p>
	As a bonus for you generosity, if you can donate at least $25 and <span class="popup__open" style="border-bottom: 0.25px solid $color-grey">send me an email letting me know <i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></span>, I will personally make you one of the QMB prototypes like the one shown in the video.

<h5>Other ways to help</h5>
<p>
	If you can't afford to give cash bucks, we can use a lot of different equipment and materials too. For quipment, we're going to need to use a spot welder for a bit, and we'd rather not have to rent time on one. Also, any previous BRC camp material will come in handy for keeping a roof over our heads during all of this. For materials, most of what we need is basically junk anyway, but it takes a lot of effort to collect it.  We need used tents, tarps, LED strands, scrap metal and electronics goods.  We also need a <em>ton</em> of destroyed bike tubes.  And if you have a Gieger counter lying around we could use a couple of those too.</p>

<p>
	We have a detailed item list that you can view here if you'd like to contribute something.  If you have anything useful and you live somewhere in the SF Bay Area, <span class="popup__open" style="border-bottom: 0.25px solid $color-grey">send me an email <i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></span>, and I'll come pick it up from you.
</p>

<p>
	Finally, if you really love the project and you want to really get your hands dirty, we have a bunch of stuff that still needs to be built.  We'd love any assistance or advice. We are also looking for two more crew members to come with us to the Playa this year so please reach out if you are interested.
