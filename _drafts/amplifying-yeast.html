    If you don't want eat bread like every three days, feeding a sourdough starter can seem a little wasteful.  But in this time of minimally available yeast it can also help to extend your yeast supply a little.  Here's how I've been amplifying my instant yeast stock with brown sugar for the past few weeks.
</p>

<h4>Instruction</h4>
<p>
    This is just my rough guide.  I'll update if I get more scientific information in the future.
</p>

<h6>ingredients</h6>
<p>
    We will be combining sugar, water, and yeast in a sterilized container.  The exact proportions probably matter a lot, but I don't know how.  I combine <strong>1/2 cup to a whole cup of water</strong> with about <strong>1 tablespoon of brown sugar</strong>.  I use as little yeast as I can get away with, normally around a <strong>1/4 teaspoon of yeast</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Hopefully, a very good yeast biologist or home brewer will get in touch soon and tell me exactly what the ratio should be.  I'll keep you posted
</p>
<h6>equipment</h6>
<p>
    All we really need is someplace for our yeast to live while they eat.  I do this with a glass jar and a bit of tin foil to cover it.  You probably don't want to seal the jar with a lid because the yeast will be belching out CO2 and we don't really want to pressurize our jar/carbonate our water if we can help it.
</p>


<h6>sanitize</h6>
<p>
    Because we aren't going for sourbread we want to try to get our amplification environment as free from outside bacteria as possible.  To do this we boil our jar and the tin foil covering. I put it in boiling water for about 5 minute and then pull it out with fork.
</p>

<h6>boil wort</h6>
<p>
    The yeast will be eating sugar in water.  We want the sugar well mixed and free from bacteria so we boil it first. I boil for a couple of minutes.
</p>

<h6>cool wort</h6>
<p>
    Drinking boiling water hurts yeast just as much as it hurts us (even more).  Pour the boiling wort into the jar and cool the jar form the outside with some water.  I throw some ice cubes in to cool it faster.
</p>

<h6>add yeast</h6>
<p>
    Once the wort is cool, toss in some yeast.  There should be a bit of action right at the beginning but over time it should slow down.
</p>

<h6>let it grow</h6>
<p>
    Set it someplace dark and warmish for a long time. I don't know how long it takes to consume all the sugar and how fast it multiplies.  I normally do 8 hours.  <strong>If you know these facts, please tell me and I'll report it here.</strong>
</p>

<h6>smell it</h6>
<p>
    After you've let it go for a
</p>

<h6>use it</h6>
<p>
    Use it just like the water and yeast mixture it is.  Adapt to your recipe.
</p>


<h4>Things to consider</h4>
<p>
    If you do this take care of the rest of the yeast in your packet.
