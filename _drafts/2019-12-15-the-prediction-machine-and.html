basically, if you have a vivid enough prediction machine for the AI task you are building, you have built a simple consciousness.  intuition that our minds produce our experience through prediction: pain being more vivid when we see the needle experiment where the wince comes even though we don't see the pain in a gif  making an ai that predicts how you will respond and whether you will like the text it spits out.
