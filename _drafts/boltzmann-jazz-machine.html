<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">  <p>Here's one of the better songs this model</p>  <h4>Origin</h4> <p>This project originated from a silly grad student Art+Science project at the University of Chicago about 5 years ago.  Basically, they said they'd give $100 to the first and second prize winners who delivered original works of art that had some underpinning in science.  There were two categories: one in video and one in music. I entered both.</p><p> To start, I haphazardly produced a tremendously stupid video of dropping bits of rice onto a piece of paper.  Afterwards, for the music category, I spent a proper week of work devising a genius method for generating jazz improvization from a statistical mechanical Ising model.  The stupid rice video won first prize in the video category while the <strong>tunable, automated jazz generator</strong> only one second prize in music. What can I say?</p> <p>I'll admit that the melody I picked wasn't very great and the synthesizer was terrible, but it was only a proof of concept.  I still feel like the idea was quite astonishing coming from a farm-boy in his first year of graduate school, and I can't understand how these fantastic physicists and chemists at the university couldn't understand it. (Well, now that I've worked with them for a few more years I understand better).</p> <p>I wrote the code for the original composition in MATLAB, and then converted the output to sound with Csound.  It wasn't done elegantly, and but fortunately, I happened to keep a hold of it.  </p> <p>I won't go into the original code that much because I built a thoroughly better version, relying on my much-imporved understanding of statistical techniques.  I now understand that essentially what i had dreamed up was just a rudimentary form of Boltzmann machine&mdash;a precursor to the neural net.</p> <h4></h4>     <br /></div>
