<p>This summer, I went to a big <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=party+in+the+desert">party in the desert</a> for the first time.  Among the many things that I found intoxicating about the event, was that the community tries to get everybody to focus on the <a href="https://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/">cultural principle</a> of Immediacy.  As the organization describes it:</p> 
<blockquote>
	Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in <a href="https://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/">our culture</a>. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers. No idea can substitute for this experience.
</blockquote>

<p>
	Over the course of the week, I found myself coming more and more in contact with my immediate experience. One cause is probably the constant struggle to survive in the sometimes comically harsh conditions.
</p>

<p>
	Another major cause is the constant instantaneous gratification of having spontaneous adventures with awesome people.  At the time, I couldn't articulate this sensation, but after returning from the event, I noticed the change.  In the real world, I could recognize how easily I was being sucked into thoughts of past and present. 
</p>  
<h4>A gift for the default world</h4>
<p>
	I wanted to try to extend the experience of immediate interaction back into the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Default%20World">default world</a>.  For me, the biggest gap between Burning Man and the rest of life, is that at Burning Man, you can pretty much talk to anyone in a much more open way.  I felt like this was because everyone there was totally trying to stay in the moment, and never make themselves too busy for others.
</p>  
<p>
	Well, in everyday life, I know that just can't be possible.  People have <a href="https://github.com/lots-of-things">lots-of-things</a> to do, and I'm as guilty as anyone.  It's impossible to find anyone who you can be sure is willing to listen, or to open up, or to just smile naturally even.  It's a shame that we live such <a href="https://twitter.com/alanwattsdaily/status/985866786359906306">busy lives</a>, but I guess it's necessary to keep the world running.
</p> 
<p>
	Anyway, I wanted to try to architect a way to bring back that sensation of immediate, unstructured contact with people at the moment they need it. To enable immediate connection, I wanted to build something that would make it possible to find all the people who also wanted to do something unplanned right at that same moment as me.  I figured the easiest way to do that was to set something up that allowed you to find all the people within walking distance who were willing to hang out.
</p> 
<h4>Immediacy App</h4>
<p>
	This idea of instantaneous connection lent itself very nicely to a location based app, which is something I'd been interested in building for a while now.  I was curious to build a more interesting app after I experimented with a toy app one for the <a href="/2018/10/experiential-puzzle-narrative.html">escape room</a> I built last year.  As a prototype, I whipped together a little Android project that I'm hoping to share with Burners back in Bay Area.</p> <p>In the screen capture, you can see the whole functionality.  Users can register or login, and then they can navigate to the Nearby Users menu where they can find somebody to chat with.
</p>

<p>
	The catch is that once they decide to chat with someone, they only have 3 total messages that they can use to find each other and connect.  That might seem strange, but again, the point is to exercise Immediacy and not dilly-dally with back and forth planning and blah-blah-blah.  
</p>
 <h4>Getting Immediacy</h4>
 <p>
 	I've recently released Immediacy in the Google Play Store.  You can view and download it here.  It's a bare bones app, meant to do the minimum to get people to talk with each other.  I'm not planning on modifying the app much, and I most certainly will never try to <em><a href="https://journal.burningman.org/2014/02/philosophical-center/tenprinciples/what-does-it-mean-to-have-decommodification-as-a-principle/">commodify</a></em> the damn thing. Still, feel free to leave me some feedback if something is broken or if you think the whole idea sucks. 
 </p>
 <p>
 	Surprisingly it only took about two days (including writing up this blog post) to build the whole thing.  If you're interested in how to make a location based app, you can <a href="/2019/10/creating-immediacy.html">read this post</a> to learn more.  
 </p> 
 <p>
 	Now enough reading things on the internet. Go find some random person to practice Immediacy with!
