<p>I've been contemplating privacy and anonymity, and speculating on what those ideas mean in the near future of our society.  During conversations with my friends and family, I've started questioning whether maintaining strengthened privacy is possible, and more importantly, whether strengthened privacy is even a good thing.</p> <p>I'm working on putting myself into an experiment on radical transparency.  Below, is an attempt at a justification for why I need to try this and a little info about how I'm starting to put it into motion.</p> <h4>The world we live in</h4> <p></p>  corporate digital surveillance on consumers online trolls will spread disinformation bot accounts     <p>The general logic around dinner tables tends to be "how can we return things to the good old days before all of this happened?"  I generally agree, if it were possible to reverse the overflowing of online life, I would do it. But as things are, it seems that society is going to continue to become more digitally connected.  So the argument continues, if we can't stop it how can we hide ourselves better.</p> <p>But every advance that lets us hide ourselves better, will let a Russian hacker, troll, or quasi-sentient AI hide themselves better. To combat them, we will need ever more all-encompassing mechanisms of monitoring. Furthermore, we'll need to .  And the cycle will continue.</p> <p>So if we can see that we're basically doomed to a privacy arms race, is there any other way forward?  </p>  <h4>A counterpoint thought experiment</h4> <p>Imagine the societies of total extreme privacy and total extreme transparency.</p>  <p>Describe the society in both extremes</p>  <p>Which of these strawman extremes would we think is better?  Clearly there are pluses and minuses to both, and the decision isn't entirely clear cut.  Still, the moral objections to extreme privacy are myriad.  Meanwhile, the moral objection to extreme transparency centers on the idea that there exist some set of things that I must be allowed to do despite society's objection to them.  </p> <p>Nevertheless, extreme transparency feels more utopian than dystopian to me.  </p> <p>The main drawback though is that it seems that such a society of transparency would be impossible. Any military would demand that it have autonomy to carry out activities outside of public scrutiny, and from there gaps in public surveillance would lead to exploitation.  If a single entity could remain outside detection, it could operate with impunity and exploit the transparency of others to its own ends.</p> <p>The classical rebuff is "What about China?" Indeed, if a state was allowed full control without the ability of its citizens to fight back in any way, the resulting situation would be miserable.  Still, China is essentially pursuing this end. The followup question is, if a citizenry could enforce this kind of transparency on the members of its government, would it be possible to avoid the despotism in the first place?</p>   <h4>An antagonistic approach</h4><p>It's probably not the smartest idea to question the motivations of everyone in the world, but it's hard to avoid when it comes to thinking about the adamant objections to universal transparency.  It seems that almost no one objects to knowing about someone else's life, for example, if a friend is caught in a lie or a criminal's story is played on the news.  No, the objection clearly comes from our own personal information being up for grabs.</p> <p>The easiest explanation I can come up with is that people have things they really don't want others to know about.  </p> <h4>Viewfoil</h4> <p>I built a very basic blog interface based off <a href="https://github.com/zaferzent/hydebloggertemplate">this template</a>.  Starting on January 1 2020, I'm going to try to start transitioning every aspect of my life onto this digital record.  Needless to say, I'm sure I will encounter myriad issues that prevent me from exploring this entirely, but I'm excited to see just where today this starts to break down.  I'm mostly scared about accidentally releasing some banking information, so I'll have to spend a lot of the first month locking down accounts.  I also have some secrets from my family, which I've wanted to bring up for some time, but I've never had the right moment to mention it.</p> <p>This is going to be an interesting year.  Check out <a href="https://viewfoil.bonkerfield.org/">viewfoil</a> if you are interested.</p>    <h4>The truth shall set you free</h4> <p>Before we begin, I need to point out that there are two separate arguments that both follow from a common principle of openness and transparency. First, whether direct honesty is really the best policy, and second, whether universal societal surveillance would cause more good than harm.  They should probably be tackled separately, but the experiment I am proposing is going to conflate them both.</p>
