<p>Anyone who has lived in two different big cities has probably had this thought cross their mind:</p>

<blockquote>
	Wow! I love this neighborhood. It's just like that other neighborhood I liked back in that other city.
</blockquote>

<p>or, alternatively</p>

<blockquote>
	Geez, this neighborhood sucks. It's pretty much the same as that other crap neighborhood back in that other city.
</blockquote>

<p>For me this happens with San Francisco and Chicago.  I like the Mission, and it reminds me of Wicker Park and Logan Square in Chicago.  On the other hand, I've also been to the Marina District, which reminds me of the Gold Coast back in Chicago (not really a fan).</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, every city has it's own character, but I started wondering if in some ways all cities are just rewarpings of each other.  </p>


<h4>Framing the question</h4>
<p>In answering this kind of question it's super important to try to get an objective meaning of what it means to be the same kind of neighborhood. My opinion that the Mission and Wicker Park are similar doesn't really make that true. To show this, I wanted to use some kind of real-world data </p>

<p>To me one of the best definitions of what makes a neighborhood similar is if the same type of people like it</p>
