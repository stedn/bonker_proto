<p>I just ran a work of speculative fiction through a piece of artificial intelligence software that once would have been called speculative. I'm realizing that we very well might be reaching a new era of science fiction and art.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if we should call this era <em>post-speculative</em>.</p>

<h4>To Be Post-speculative</h4>

<p>Speculative fiction generally works within a world where some things (eg technologies, magic, historical governments) can work in ways where the reader has no way of foreseeing the ultimate impact of these things. This is in contrast to forms of fiction that are strictly reality-based, meaning characters make choices inside the world where all the rules are already completely familiar to the reader.  What I want to describe with post-speculative is to create a work of fiction where the world in the story is approximately as unpredictable or speculative as the tools used to create it.</p>

<p>Post-speculative fiction is the realization of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message">the medium is the message</a>" in the case where message and medium are still not yet fully understood. </p>


<h4>The thing after postmodernism</h4>
<p>This is not unlike the concept of postmodernism, where the tools of modernist creation and critique were re-reflected back onto that world to create and critique it. There are more parallels with postmodernism too. I particularly like this passage I copy-pasted from wikipedia.</p>

<blockquote>
a rejection of the modernist "Utopian gesture" of the transformation through art of misery into beauty whereas in the postmodernism movement the object world has ... "now become a set of texts or simulacra". Whereas modernist art sought to redeem and sacralize the world, to give life to world, postmodernist art bestows upon the world a "deathly quality… whose glacéd X-ray elegance mortifies the reified eye of the viewer in a way that would seem to have nothing to do with death or the death obsession or the death anxiety on the level of content"
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, the speculativist aimed to point our minds at a distant horizon, and help us to tease apart just what we want our future world to look like.  The postspeculativist accepts a narrower view of the future: that someday when we live in an era with new technology, our condition will still be fundamentally the same.</p>

<p>I think the urge to create speculative fiction, particularly during and after the "Golden Age" of scifi, was a very utopian vision, similar to the grand ideals of modernism.  Even in the later cyberpunk/post-apocalypse/"they're all Cylons" era, the narratives still normally had a fairly idealistic moral core.  The evil tech conglomerate and/or the zombies were bad, and the people using super badass technology to win were good (exceptions aside). The modernist glorified on the rise of industrial technology powered by modernizing, we glorified the rise of information technology powered by speculation.</p>

<p>But now, maybe the era of speculation is coming to a close, and just like the postmodernist, we're getting to the point where we have to fully acknowledge the aftermath of the idealism we neglected to inspect before we let it happen.</p>

<h4>Explanation by example</h4>>

<p>To compare and contrast what would or wouldn't be post-speculative, we might analyze  Black Mirror episode Bandersnatch. I think that Bandersnatch was a really entertaining piece of speculative fiction, and I definitely rewatched many times to follow all the paths. And part of the reason that I rewatched was because I was hoping for something that (although I hadn't named it at the time) would have been post-speculative. </p>

<p>I had really wanted Bandersnatch to reach a point in the loop where it starts to blur the lines between the choose-your-own-adventureness and the free will of the audience member.  To reach the level of post-speculativeness, the movie would have needed to utilize some technology that made the viewer question whether the. </p>

<p>For example, if Netflix offered the option to play with the viewer's own image integrated into Bandersnatch to personalize it, and in the story, the game designer offered the same, we would clearly have crossed into the post-speculative realm.  Such a device would place the audience directly into the position of honestly considering themselves just the characters in a story for an audience in a world external to their own. </p>

<p>Although the narrative suggests something like this (while also suggesting it is madness to consider it), nothing about the medium itself really conveyed that. I mean, the mechanics weren't really any different from a videogame except for slightly better acting.</p>

<p>So to make it post-speculative, we'd have to treat the medium with respect and ackowledge that we really are in the simulation.  In this case, the simulation could be Netflix using the choices that you made in Bandersnatch to customize content they promote to you outside. Post-speculative is when we acknowledge that it is happening, and construct the medium to emphasize that it's happening.</p>

<h4>Why do this?</h4>
<p>Postmodernism became a push-back against unadulterated modernism by causing every part of modernist thought to be subject to deconstruction.  If we define a movement of deconstructing our fetishization of speculation, maybe we'll be able to dismantle it before it's too late. </p>

<p>It might be possible to push back without integrating art to the point, but that hasn't worked yet.  Even the darkest of the speculative era works still kept us thinking about those as issues to be dealt with by anti-heroes of the future. It never made us think that it would actually be us involved with the deconstruction.</p>

<p>That said, there may be a bigger problem.  I'm one of many who are fully enthralled with speculative narratives. And honestly, to see them come to life will be thrilling.  Even if we expect the ending.</p>
