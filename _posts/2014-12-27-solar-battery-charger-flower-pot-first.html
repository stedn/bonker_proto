This is my first attempt at attaching a solar battery charger like <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5752731/built-a-4-diy-solar-battery-charger">this one</a> to a flower pot.  The style of the pot isn't exactly what I was looking for.  I was hoping to have the top at an angle that faced the sun better, but my friend who made the pots couldn't get them to stay flat during baking.  The next edition will have a better pot and hopefully will work to charge cell phones as well. <img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0cAr7rofgBk/VJ9Aml-NqBI/AAAAAAAAA_Y/5fi1jvpwTxA/s1600/IMG_0154.JPG" title=" "/>
