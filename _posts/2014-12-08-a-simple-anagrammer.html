A while back, I wrote a little python code that takes in a word and spits out a list of anagram words.  It kind of takes the fun out of generating anagrams, but it puts the fun back in by letting you figure out how I made them.  Could you do it a better way?  You can look at my <a href="https://github.com/lots-of-things/simple-anagrammer"> simple-anagrammer </a> code on github.
