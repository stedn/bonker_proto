        For the past couple of months, I've been obsessed with <a href="http://neilcicierega.com/">Neil Cicierega</a>'s amazing <a href="mashup of marshmello Alone and early 2000s maudlin smash hit i hope you dance">mashups</a>. Basically, he does an unbelievably amazing job of squeezing tons of irony and kitsch out of a bunch of 90s and 2000s songs. His work has a very DIY feel, and it very much comes out of the internet culture, but the work is really impeccable and just sooo funny.

<p>
<i>btw, I just looked up the links for Neil Cicierega and ended up spending the last two hours listening to his music again.</i>

        Anyway, <a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/imitation-is-the-sincerest-form-of-flattery.html">imitation is the sickest form of flattery</a> so I decided I would play around with mashing up a couple of tunes myself. I've always liked the idea of merging dance music with country music because the only famous example is the <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/82584/long-history-behind-song-cotton-eye-joe">notably horrible Cotton Eye Joe</a>. After deciding to do a country tune merged with a dance songe, the obvious choice for me was the classic <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-schmich-sunscreen-column-column.html">wear your suncreen</a> of the south: <a href="http://www.greatamericanthings.net/music/songs-music/song-i-hope-you-dance/">Hope you dance</a> by appropriately triple named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Ann_Womack">Lee Ann Womack</a>. For the dance track, I decided to just mash it up with an instrumental of Marshmello's Alone for the sole reason that I just think that track is great.
    </p>
<p>
        Here's my mashup on youtube dubbed over clips from the original music video. It's not great, but I kind of like it in a weird way. Read below for more on how to make a track like this.

<h3>The Audacity of Dope</h3>
<p>
        All the music editing took place using the <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> open source music editor. The community surrounding this software is great and there are already a ton of tutorials to get you started. I'm going to focus primarily on the process for grabbing a bunch of music that you like off of youtube and putting it together.
    </p>

<h6>downloading some audio</h6>
<p>
        The first step is to download music. I got all of mine off of youtube using <a href="https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/mp3-converter">this site</a>. Since this was just a fun project, I didn't fuss too much with getting really good audio. My primary focus was trying to get music with audio and instrumental separated so that I could merge them without having the instruments conflict. I was able to do that for Alone, but old country songs don't have a very wide remixing community so I had to make due on my own.
    </p>
<h6>removing instrumentals</h6>
<p>
        I played around with a couple of the examples in <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/tutorial_vocal_removal_and_isolation.html">this tutorial</a> from Audacity. They worked to a certain degree, but there are still fragments of instruments in the background of the Womack track. I just went with it and tried to incorporate them in a musical way.
    </p>
<h6>beat matching</h6>
    Once I had the music and vocals more or less isolated, there was one crucial step called beat matching. basically, the two songs were in very different tempos so I tried to get them close to the same speed so that I could merge them without the two tracks getting out of sync. To do this, I first estimated the bpm of the songs by tapping to the beat on an <a href="http://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm">online bpm tool</a>. This gave me a relative difference in tempo, which I could use to adjust one of the tracks using Audacity's <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/change_tempo.html">change tempo feature</a>. <img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2KRmZpY6twg/WTowqENdMzI/AAAAAAAAIYg/z_JlyQx7DM8HxsPV9pIHx7WSqdLyypZ3gCLcB/s1600/change_tempo_w10.png" title=" "/>
<h6>slice and dice</h6>
<p>
        After this, basically all I did was slice audio clips, and copy and paste them into an Audacity project with the instrumental running in the background. I <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/change_pitch.html">changed the pitch</a> of the clips in different ways in different places, but I just adjusted the pitch by ear until it sounded sort of OK. Occasionally, I'd just start throwing random effects onto clips, but I never really kept track of what I was doing so I can't really describe what I did there.
    </p>
<p>
        Long story short, you just have to play around for a long time to massage the clips into the surrounding beat track. This took me about 4 nights of continuous work and then another maybe three or four where I would just poke around for 15 minutes. I suspect that the next time I do this it will take significantly less time, but I will end up with a significantly better project. I didn't have too high of hopes so the product I ended up with was good enough for me to finalize the project and move on.
    </p>
<h3>Throwing together a video</h3>
<p>
        Finally, I really wanted to see this weird new song stitched back in with the original music video. So I went about getting a copy of the video from youtube. If you don't know already, all you have to do to download a youtube video is add ss to the url as described <a href="http://www.nairaland.com/1934159/how-download-youtube-videos-using">here</a> (and a moillion other places online.
    </p>
<p>
        After you download the mp4, you can edit in any video editor. I used this really janky program called <a href="https://www.shotcut.org/">ShotCut</a>, but I would not recommend it. It served its purpose for me, but I'm sure there must be better video editing packages out there.
    </p>

<p>
        I won't describe how to slice and dice a video up, but I will give you a few suggestions if you want to upload a copyrighted video to youtube. After you do all the editing, just add a ton of crazy filters so that none of the original video appears in its original condition in your final product. Otherwise youtube will block it automatically.
    </p>
<p>
        Note: I think this is all legal because it falls under fair use, but then again, I'm not a lawyer so if anybody cease and desists you, just take it down and don't fight them. That probably won't happen if you make something as crappy as the music I made, but keep it in mind.
