<p><em><small>
    Epistemic status: It should go without saying that I don't have any certainty about the fundamental nature of the universe.  This is just a bit of conjecture that gets me through my day.
</small></em></p>

<p>
    In my previous writing, I've derived informal proofs to show that I must act as though <a href="">the universe has a purpose</a>, and that while the universe's purpose is not knowable with certainty, I must act as though correct action <a href="">is discoverable</a>.  In this work, I wish to lay out my argument for intuition as a way of sensing the correct actions that will aid in the fulfillment of the underlying purpose of the universe.
</p>
<p>
    While this post is not entirely coherent from the point of view of classical deductive reasoning, I wish to point out ahead of time that the method of argumentation used is consistent with the method of action advocated by the argument (ie intuition).  In this sense, the following is at least self-consistent, though potentially not entirely complete to all observers.
</p>

<h4>Decision making and uncertainty</h4>
<p>
    Previously, I've noted that the purpose of the universe is <a href="">probably not directly detectable</a>, and that there exist an infinite number of possible explanations for the universe's purpose that we cannot even imagine. Nevertheless, it can help introduce this derivation by imagining that we had some finite set of options that we believe could be plausible descriptions of the purpose of the universe.
</p>
<p>
    If this were the case, then it would be possible to enumerate the options and assign our estimated confidence that each one was the true purpose of the universe. Take for example the following three arbitrarily chosen pet hypotheses.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Religion: Satisfactorily worship a vengeful deity</li>
    <li>Time Miners: Allow a species that exists in an external metauniverse to drill holes to mine time</li>
    <li>Simulation:. Simulate the real earth to prevent a natural disaster</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For each of these pet theories we could then assign some probability that we think it is the true purpose of the universe.  Take for example these three assignments.
</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Purpose</th>
    <th>Probability</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody style='text-align:center;'>
  <tr>
    <td>Religion</td>
    <td>0.5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Time Miners</td>
    <td>0.3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Simulation</td>
    <td>0.2</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
    Now, if we assume that we wish to maximize the probability that we would be aiding the purpose of the universe with our actions, we could allocate our efforts to take the set of actions best suited to that goal. As an example assume that we have the following three actions to choose from, which each contribute toward the above goals by differing amounts. In addition, each costs us a certain amount of time per day.
</p>

<table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Action</th>
    <th>Contribution to Religion</th>
    <th>Contribution to Time Miners</th>
    <th>Contribution to Simulation</th>
    <th>Time Allocation (hours per day)</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody style='text-align:center;'>
  <tr>
    <td>Go to church once a week</td>
    <td>0.8</td>
    <td>0.2</td>
    <td>0.3</td>
    <td>0.01</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Become a devout monk</td>
    <td>0.95</td>
    <td>0.2</td>
    <td>0.1</td>
    <td>24</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Study quantum physics</td>
    <td>0.0</td>
    <td>0.7</td>
    <td>0.3</td>
    <td>8</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
    So, assuming we had only the above three options, and that we had confidence in our assessment in probability of each of the above purposes to be correct, we could optimize our total probability of aiding the universe. As an example, let us coompare these two options: becoming a devout monk vs studying quantum physics and going to church.
</p>
<p>
    By the above estimate, becoming a devout monk is all consuming (24 hours/day) so we only account for that action's success probabilities.  In other words, our total probability of helping the universe as a monk is <code>0.95*0.5 + 0.2*0.3 + 0.1*0.2 = 0.555</code>.  Next we compare this with the total probability of success for studying quantum physics and going to church once a week.  For that we can add the probabilities of both actions because we have the bandwidth to do both things. This set of actions results in <code>(0.0+0.8)*0.5 + (0.7+0.2)*0.3 + (0.3+0.3)*0.2 = 0.79</code>*.
</p>
<p><em><small>
    *Caveat: I know that the way I've combined the probabilities isn't exactly proper here.  In reality we would need to account for each set of choices dependent on each set of other choices.  However, that is beyond the scope of this explainer and doesn't contribute deeply to the gist of the argument.
</small></em></p>

<p>
    From this calculation we would conclude that it's better to study quantum physics and go to church than to become a devout monk.  Even though becoming a devout monk best satisfies the thing we think is most important (appeasing an angry god), its all-consuming nature prevents us from satisfying other plausible purposes at the same time.  Therefore, it is too costly to devote ourselves entirely to that cause at the expense of other propositions.
</p>

<p>
    So if choosing our path in life just came down to working out some probabilistic math, then it would seem our decisions should be simple. Unfortunately, it can't be quite that easy.
</p>


<h4>The problem with assigning probabilities</h4>

<p>
    The problem with assigning probabilities is that we just cannot know all the possible purposes of the universe and the probabilities of each. In fact, rather than being able to enumerate a precise list of purposes, we should probably assume that there are actually infinite possibilities.  If this is the case, there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal">effectively 0</a> probability that any single purpose that we decide on is the correct one.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond this, there are a staggering number of actions available to us.  While the number of options isn't truly infinite, the varying degrees to which we can devote ourselves to each course of action available places the number of distinct possible lives we could live outside the limit of my imagination at least.
</p>
<p>
    So there is clearly no way to directly compute the proper course of action using the above procedure without making other assumptions about the space of available purposes and actions.  There is no easy resolution, and yet, through <a href="">previous arguments</a>, we still must assume there is some resolution.  So what is there to do?
</p>

<h4>Using Intuition</h4>
<p>
    I posit that the only resolution to this conundrum is that there must be some subtle revelation of the correct course of action to any actor in the universe.  This could happen in many ways, depending on the exact state of the actor, but I hold that the most likely mechanism of this revelation for humans is through some indescribable set of instincts and biases we call our <em>intuition</em>.
</p>

<p>
    The leap to accepting intuition, of course, lacks the rigor that previous derivations built upon. However, as I cannot propose any other resolution given the constraints of my more rigorous philosophy, I am currently accepting this hypothesis as a working hypothesis. In addition, as I have arrived at this leap using my own intuition, it is at the least not out of keeping with the philosophy it proposes. (Since Goedel tells us we can't have completeness and consistency anyway, I will at least choose to keep consistency where possible.)
</p>
<p>
    To think about how intuition can satisfy the above,
</p>



<h4>Superposition of intuitions</h4>
<p>
    To make this more clear I have diagrammed a single axis of "purposes" that could exist.  Imagine that there are an infinite set of possible purposes each varying from one another in some continuous way.  These are graphed along the x-axis of the top figure.  Furthermore at each point, there is an estimate in how probable that purpose is to be the "true purpose" of the universe.
</p>

<p>
    Below that figure I have graphed a continuous space of possible actions and their contribution toward the purpose above.
</p>

<p>
    This is my assumption of how our intuitions must work.  Somehow, the universe reveals the set of actions that will maximize the , and we can choose to listen and carry out these actions.
</p>

<h4>Relation with quantum physics</h4>
<p>
    To arrive at this description, I used intuition I've gained from my past study of quantum wave function collapse. The intuition is only approximate.
</p>
<p>
    This thought experiment is analogous to what's know as a quantum wavefunction. over all possible actions when measured against the fulfilment of the purpose of the universe. Importantly, it would never be possible to directly observe this wavefunction itself. The wavefunction has an unobservable state, that at some point in the future collapses into a single observation, which in this case would be either fulfillment of the universe's purpose or not. The way it would work in a quantum experiment is that you would perform the actions that you believed would maximize the probability that, upon measurement, the wavefunction would collapse into the successful state.
</p>
<p>
    One reason that I find this analogy compelling is that it offers a plausible justification for why we would live in a universe with such preposterous physics as is suggested by our understanding of quantum mechanics.  For me, this would be a good hint at the purpose of the universe if either (a) something about the revelatory mechanism required quantum physics or (b) quantum physics was left as an intuitive hint to reveal the fundamentality of probabilstic intuition.
</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
    This is the current conclusion of my philosophical statement of beliefs.  It is a work in progress, and I reserve the right to edit parts as it becomes more clear how to make this thesis more clear.
</p>
<p>
    Importantly, I wish the reader to recognize that this philosophy really does underpin the work I am trying to do with my life.  It is an important anchor in my productive goals, and the creative works that I produce.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, I hope it goes without saying that I only want this philosophy to improve. If you believe that you see a major flaw in my reasoning, or if you believe something is underexplained, please do not hesitate to <a href="https://viewfoil.bonkerfield.org/">contact me</a> to start a conversation.  I will definitely respond to any good faith attempts at refutation.
</p>
<p>
    OK, that concludes this philosophical effort for now.  Bye, have fun existing!
