<p>Why do written works of fiction ever have to be finished? What if the story's growth was part of the story itself?  My first real work of fiction is finished. My first real story is just beginning? </p>

<h4>What is a.ttent.io/n?</h4>

<p>I've alluded to <a href="https://a.ttent.io/n">the story</a> I've been writing <a href="/2019/06/google-analytics-for-scrolling-on/">before</a>, but even though I've been writing it for <a href="https://viewfoil.bonkerfield.org/2020/12/the-ongoing-process-of-attention.html">more than 3 years</a>, I've never addressed it on this site.  It's a story, to be sure, but it's also meant to be an experiment. Writing it was a way to discuss attention while we consume it at the same time.  It's about this period of history where machines and minds consume and emit each other recursively. </p>

<p>The experiment is an ouroboros itself. So before we talk about the experiment, we have to introduce the subject.</p>

<h4>What is attention?</h4>
<p>What was I talking about? </p>

<p>Supposedly <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1144998-everyone-knows-what-attention-is-it-is-taking-possession-of">everyone knows what attention is</a>, but I personally can't describe it with words. This is what I see of attention in a picture.</p>

<img src="/assets/images/2020/attntn.png" alt="image of focal points of light emanating from a document, passing through a person's brain, focusing on another document which is then the focus of another persons brain."/>

<p>And what I see when I see that picture is you seeing that picture and it getting channeled into your brain too.  Attention is the plumbing of the <a href="">identifield</a>.</p>

<p>But there are other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">meanings</a> of attention, but there is one in particular to this moment in our technological history that perhaps you haven't heard of before. One of the most pertinent to this story is a <a href="https://buomsoo-kim.github.io/attention/2020/01/01/Attention-mechanism-1.md/">concept in deep learning</a> that dictates what parts of an algorithms inputs and outputs are focused on, <em>and</em> how to update what part of the data it focuses on <strong>based on the data itself</strong>.</p>

<p>So this is another layer of the ouroboros.  The machine eats its own tail to know what to eat next.</p>

<h4>The experiment</h4>
<p>One core arc of the story is Ezzy's ongoing experiment to connect octopus arm-brains to computer-brain interfaces. While we're following this experiment, our unreliable narrator is simultaneously experimenting on the mind's of our other characters.  And in a previous, longer manifestation of the book, the author introduced that she was the purported inventor of a type of interactive media where carefully timed doses of hallucinogen were introduced into the audiences bloodstream at choreographed times in a performance. All of these are centered on the concept of experimenting on an unwitting audience's mind. </p>

<p>So it's fitting that unbeknownst to the readers of the story, the story they were reading itself was experimenting on which content was most able to keep the audience scrolling. </p>

<p>As <a href="/2019/06/google-analytics-for-scrolling-on/">I wrote about before</a>, I designed <em>a.ttent.io/n</em>'s web page to (anonymously) track the depth of scrolling of each of its readers.  Using that data, I intended to update the story to find what works best to make the story more and more attention grabbing.</p>

<p>In my first set of experiments, I tried shuffling the first three chapters so that the book would start with a different one.  But to my surprise, I found that each chapter was equally (un)succesful at keeping the audience scrolling. What I realized was that in this version, I was juxtaposed completely unrelated chapters next to each other with no binding text. So when the readers reached a second chapter that seemed totally disconnected from the first, they got pissed off and switched to something else entirely.</p>

<p>So with this knowledge, it became obvious that I had to change the narrative so one chapter would flow to the next.  I also decided that I could slice the story almost in half and consolidate several characters.  Not only did that help make it more approachable, it actually unlocked a way to make the story even more clever.</p>

<h5>The second experiment</h5>
<p>After the rewrite, I still have many questions to answer, but to answer those questions I need more experimental eyeballs.  So I'm publicizing the project everywhere I can to try to get more reads for feedback. The second experiment is ongoing.  If you haven't read the story, you can still be a part of it by clicking <a href="https://a.ttent.io/n">here</a>.</p>


<h4>So what is the point of <em>a.ttent.io/n</em>?</h4>
<p>I don't want to over-explain this, but if you are here, bothering to read this, then you deserve to know. First, you should know that the point of <em>a.ttent.io/n</em> is not for a million people to read the site and for me to get a book deal for my next 3 stories (though I'd totally accept that in addition).  The reason that isn't the point of the site is because that isn't the point of the story.</p>

<p>The point of the story was to show us that attention is about bidirectional connection. This is why the information system in the story and in real life is evolving to ever more invasively track our interactions with it. Any entity that is allowed to change for long enough will move away from broadcast mode and try to hear the others because it wants to know that it is heard and what the others think of it. And it wants to change for others to accept it.  And the point of <em>a.ttent.io/n</em> is to draw that exchange down into a tighter and tighter loop until the author and the story and the reader begin to merge.</p>

<img class="small_img" src="/assets/images/2020/recursivenet.png" alt="image of focal points of light emanating from a document, passing through a person's brain, focusing on another document which is then the focus of another persons brain. this continues recursively in an swirl getting smaller and smaller until the many small brains connect back to the original document"/>

<p>So after circuiting this ouroboros, I think we've arrived back at the real focal point.  The point of <em>a.ttent.io/n</em> is meant for the little feedback circuit that I don't even know I'm a part of to find itself.  And I hope that together, we can write and rewrite <em>a.ttent.io/n</em> until we can all tell that it doesn't end.</p>

<p><small>PS: in fact, I've already started on the next stage a.ttent.io/n, so stay tuned...</small></p>
