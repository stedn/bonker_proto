    Ever since working on my partner's <a href="http://www.makeloft.org/2017/04/engagement-ring-from-found-smoky-quartz.html">engagement ring</a> last year, I've become more and more interested in making custom jewelry for people. Recently, I happened upon another interesting raw material, and I decided to see what I could make.
</p>
<h3>Sustainable Ivory</h3>
<p>
    Mammal teeth and tusks are made of the same thing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory">dentine</a>. So, when I had my wisdom teeth removed, I kept them to try to fabricate some "sustainable ivory" jewelry from them.
</p>
<p>
    I'll spare showing you my cavity filled wisdom teeth in their raw form.
</p>
<p>
    I grabbed my Dremel and started carving a spiral groove around the edges. After cutting away a bit of that and turning the shape a little, I had the following.

<p>
    I continued thinning down that shape for a while, until I accidentally took it just a bit too far, and one of them shattered into multiple pieces. Kind of sad, but on the other hand, they were a little large for earrings. Instead, I ended up wrapping the remaining one in a bit of steel wire, to be used as a necklace pendant.

    I found <a href="https://majeruslucie.eu/H-U-M-A-N-I-V-O-R-Y">another artist</a> who did <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/sustainable-product-design/human-ivory-lucie-majerus.html">something similar</a> before. Hopefully people aren't too weirded out by the idea as it seems a hell of a lot more reasonable than poaching ivory or sending people into mines for stupid shiny shit.
