I find myself being drawn to explore the co-op business model and what it means for building a solidarity economy.  While discussing these ideas with my partner Claire, we brainstormed an idea to showcase the solidarity economy across the US on a travel tour.

One of my big inspirations is Kirsten Dirksen, who produces her own series of documentaries on alternative dwelling spaces with a very distinctive style.  I thought it would be very cool to do something like that.

So, for next summer, my partner and I are planning on taking some extended time off to finally travel for our honeymoon. And while we're traveling, we're going to try to make a documentary about all kinds of co-ops and other organizations in the solidarity economy.

Our goal is to make a round trip from California, through the Pacific Northwest, down to Denver, then across the Midwest to Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois, then back around through the southwest to California again.  We expect it to take the better part of a year.  Importantly, we've decided that we will do this using a solar powered electric tandem bike.  I'll be writing more about that build over this winter as it comes together.
