So in keeping with the holiday spirit I'm now showing off the little bag I made for my girlfriend's mom. She's an avid <a href="http://lillstreet.com/department/ceramics-sculpture">ceramicist</a> so I made this bag to keep her tools. <img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NHNTr6jR-Zo/VJi2B-i4GwI/AAAAAAAAA9Q/5s2a-6kX5w4/s1600/2014-12-21%2B14.58.36.jpg" title=" " />

    Over the summer she got me a golf bag to replace my old rundown broken one. (Oh how I wish I had a picture of the old one. It was kind of embarrassing. It looked a little something like this except with a gaping 2 foot hole in the side from which clubs would occasionally fall out.) </p>

    I figured she'd really like it if I reused the leather to make her a gift. I was originally thinking about just a leather belt until my girlfriend actually came up with the idea for a tool pouch for her ceramics equipment.
</p>
<h4>How I made it</h4>
<p>
    The exterior comes from three 4 by 17ish swaths of faux leather/canvas pulled from different intact parts of the bag. I sewed them together lengthwise and rounded the edges for the zipper to go around smoothly.
</p>

<p>
    The zipper came from a mid 90s computer case that I condensed to create a 2010s computer case. In that project, I had removed a section which left over a small ribbon of zipper that I could reuse. This didn't leave too much edge for the zipper so my stitching had to be pretty precise to hold.

<p>
    On the inside I wanted to have little tool holder straps for ceramics tools to fit in. I didn't know the exact sizing because I couldn't find a casual way to bring up the dimensions of her ceramics tools without arousing suspicion. So I guessed that I could put strips in two orientations and most things would fit somehow.

<p>
    Interestingly I learned that I would have to add decorative stitching on the outside to continue my lines because otherwise it just looked really bad.
</p>
<p>
    I'm really pleased with the result. Sewing is a new skill to me, but it's worth it to learn. <br />
