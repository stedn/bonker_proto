<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">So in keeping with the holiday spirit I'm now showing off the little bag I made for my girlfriend's mom.  She's an avid <a href="http://lillstreet.com/department/ceramics-sculpture">ceramicist</a> so I made this bag to keep her tools.   <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NHNTr6jR-Zo/VJi2B-i4GwI/AAAAAAAAA9Q/5s2a-6kX5w4/s1600/2014-12-21%2B14.58.36.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NHNTr6jR-Zo/VJi2B-i4GwI/AAAAAAAAA9Q/5s2a-6kX5w4/s320/2014-12-21%2B14.58.36.jpg" /></a></div> <p>Over the summer she got me a golf bag to replace my old rundown broken one.  (Oh how I wish I had a picture of the old one.  It was kind of embarrassing.  It looked a little something like this except with a gaping 2 foot hole in the side from which clubs would occasionally fall out.) <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1TtLY0oCtww/VJH9M2rbiZI/AAAAAAAAA8s/opY6twDVm7E/s1600/m18uBHjUbHQ4tsfQuGPeI6g.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1TtLY0oCtww/VJH9M2rbiZI/AAAAAAAAA8s/opY6twDVm7E/s200/m18uBHjUbHQ4tsfQuGPeI6g.jpg" /></a></div><p> I figured she'd really like it if I reused the leather to make her a gift.  I was originally thinking about just a leather belt until my girlfriend actually came up with the idea for a tool pouch for her ceramics equipment.  </p><h4>How I made it</h4><p>The exterior comes from three 4 by 17ish swaths of faux leather/canvas pulled from different intact parts of the bag. I sewed them together lengthwise and rounded the edges for the zipper to go around smoothly.</p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-u3gnN1f3Vvo/VJi2CGdtMWI/AAAAAAAAA9U/k-ZnGNPgLwk/s1600/2014-12-21%2B14.59.10.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-u3gnN1f3Vvo/VJi2CGdtMWI/AAAAAAAAA9U/k-ZnGNPgLwk/s320/2014-12-21%2B14.59.10.jpg" /></a></div> <p>The zipper came from a mid 90s computer case that I condensed to create a 2010s computer case.  In that project, I had removed a section which left over a small ribbon of zipper that I could reuse.  This didn't leave too much edge for the zipper so my stitching had to be pretty precise to hold.  </p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WoB5YewGNNk/VJi2C8LY1qI/AAAAAAAAA9k/XZ54E9JKauA/s1600/2014-12-21%2B14.59.50.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WoB5YewGNNk/VJi2C8LY1qI/AAAAAAAAA9k/XZ54E9JKauA/s320/2014-12-21%2B14.59.50.jpg" /></a></div> <p>On the inside I wanted to have little tool holder straps for ceramics tools to fit in.  I didn't know the exact sizing because I couldn't find a casual way to bring up the dimensions of her ceramics tools without arousing suspicion.  So I guessed that I could put strips in two orientations and most things would fit somehow.  </p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RZ2jN5W141c/VJi2B1_kfaI/AAAAAAAAA9c/IjHiJPDWpdA/s1600/2014-12-21%2B14.58.54.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RZ2jN5W141c/VJi2B1_kfaI/AAAAAAAAA9c/IjHiJPDWpdA/s320/2014-12-21%2B14.58.54.jpg" /></a></div> <p>Interestingly I learned that I would have to add decorative stitching on the outside to continue my lines because otherwise it just looked really bad.</p> <p> I'm really pleased with the result.  Sewing is a new skill to me, but it's worth it to learn.  <br /></div>
