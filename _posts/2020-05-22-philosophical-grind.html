<p><em><small>
    Epistemic status: It should go without saying that I don't have any certainty about the fundamental nature of the universe.  This is just a bit of conjecture that gets me through my day.
</small></em></p>

<p>
    What causes us to choose one action as opposed to another?  There are, of course, instantaneous needs that must be met, but how do we decide the bigger questions in life?
</p>

<p>
    Over the past several months I have formulated a resolution to this question that I believe makes the fewest necessary assumptions about the structure of the universe.  It is mostly centered around an abstracted form of Pascal's wager, but without the necessity of assuming extrinsic rewards or a particular belief system.  It can be summarized with the following.
</p>
<blockquote>
Assuming assuming that a purpose to the universe is not impossible, and that one wishes to help fulfill the purpose of the universe, should such a purpose exist, then one should choose their actions based on what they believe will be conducive to fulfilling the purpose of the universe.
</blockquote>
<p>
    I have previously <a href="/2019/10/sub-identity-suicide/">worked through</a> a personally limited justification of the above statment. Below I will try to prove this statement more generally and show what it implies.
</p>

<h4>The Philosophical Grind</h4>
<p>
    The statement has two necessary premises that must first be addressed.  So, can you answer yes to the following questions?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Is it possible that the universe has a purpose?</li>
    <li>If the universe has a purpose, would you prioritize trying to fulfill it?</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The first only asks whether it is possible; it need not even be likely. To negate that premise should require some sort of proof that I do not believe anyone has.  The second, is up to the individual, but I believe it is reasonable to assume it is true for most well-intentioned people.
</p>
<p>
    Given the first premise we can posit that the universe we live in must fall into one of three mutually exclusive classes.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Universe has no purpose</li>
<li>Universe has some purpose but it is undiscoverable</li>
<li>Universe has some purpose and it is discoverable</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Using the second premise, we can state whether we should modify our actions dependent on which of the above three types of universes we live in.
</p>
<p>
    In the first two types of universe (no purpose or unidscoverable purpose), there is no reason to modify the course of my action.  If either of the first two options are true, then no matter how hard I try, I can never predict what I should do. In one case, I can't predict because there is nothing to predict, and in the other it is because no information I have can be used to derive what I should do.
</p>
<p>
    In contrast, if the universe has a discoverable purpose, under the second premise, I would be obligated to modify my course of action to try to fulfill that purpose.
</p>
<p>
    If I then assume I can be in any of the universes, I can make my actions based on some combination of all actions prescribed dependent on the universe I occupy. But of course, the only universe with an actual prescribed action was the one where the universe has a purpose.  In short, the space of outcomes where my modification of action achieves nothing is ignorable because, under those conditions, the outcome is the same regardless of whether I do or do not modify my actions.  Therefore, given that I think there is a nonzero probability of my change in course of action being valuable toward a goal that I would pursue, I must follow the strategy where I modify my actions to further that goal.
</p>


<h4>Notes on a discoverable purpose</h4>
<p>
    Given the above, it becomes necessary to ask, how can I discover the purpose of the universe in order that I may act to fulfill it?  This unfortunately is not as easily a solved problem.  To show why, I try to break down the universe with a discoverable purpose into its two subcategories.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Universe's purpose is knowable with certainty</li>
<li>Universe's purpose is only intuitable</li>
</ul>
<p>
    To completely negate the possibility that the universe's purpose is knowable with certainty is probably not possible. Instead, I fall back to an empirical argument that the reader can accept of deny based on their own views.
</p>
<p>
    Personally, I can't endorse any finite collection of views on a certainly knowable universe.  Without making further ssumptions, any favorite flavor of purpose must be regarded as possible, but not certain, equivalent to any of the uncountable infinity of other possible explanations that no one has ever even fathomed.
</p>

<p>
    Nevertheless, action in a universe where valid action is totally not discernible is equivalent to action in a purposeless universe, which we have decided to ignore based on the above argument. Therefore, the only conlusion that I can arrive at is that actions conducive to the resolution of the purpose of the universe must be ascertainable even though the direct explanation of the purpose is not.
</p>
<p>
    This conclusion can probably be fulfilled in a number of different ways.  However, the most efficient explanation I can devise for this situation is that correct actions must be intuitable. Therefore, I state the following guiding principle despite not having a direct proof.
</p>
<blockquote>
    Assuming that the purpose of the universe is not obviously revealed to the individual, the only justifiable method of choosing one's actions is to follow one's intuitions.
</blockquote>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
    In this thought experiment I believe we have shown that the appropriate course of action is to assume that there is a purpose to the universe and that through intuition one can best assess the correct action to attain the purpose of the universe.  This is, of course a highly debatable topic, and I don't pretend that I have all the answers.  However, I think that this offers a valid rebuttal to materialistic nihilism, and I encourage you to utilize the argument if you find yourself dealing with an individual who advocates such a position.
</p>
<p>
    If you have any feedback on this philosophy I would greatly appreciate it.
</p>


<h4>Note: Differences with Pascal's wager</h4>
<p>
    There is some similarity between this argument and Pascal's wager. Pascal's wager posits that a person should choose to believe in God because the reward is infinite while the sacrifice is at most finite. However, there are several flaws with argument. To me the crucial flaw is that it starts with a multitude of assumptions that corner it into a very small corner of the entire space of universe possibilities.
</p>
<p>
    To begin, it assumes a binary choice between a single God to worship or not to worship. In reality, there are multiple established gods that are worshipped on Earth, each of whom provides a distinct course of correct action.  As such, the wager fails to account for multiple possible vengeful gods who will damn you if you choose your actions poorly.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, it requires one to desire everlasting reward. It seems that this in itself is not necessarily something that a reasonable person needs to desire.  For other shortcomings with the wager see the <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager">rationalwiki</a> page on the topic.
