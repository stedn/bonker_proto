 I had an old laptop case from the 90s that I wanted to update for use.  Mostly I just wanted to shrink it down to a reasonable size for a modern laptop.

 This is what the old case looked like.  Big and clunky. <img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xHT7ZbYyI-Q/VJi-Wt0ki5I/AAAAAAAAA98/nwnBz_pJB84/s1600/computer%2Bcases%2Bsamsonite%2B001.JPG" title=" "/>
