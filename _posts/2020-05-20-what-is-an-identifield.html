<p><em><small>
    Epistemic status: It should go without saying that I don't think that I'm in any way certain about the fundamental nature of the universe.  This is just a bit of conjecture that gets me through my day.
</small></em></p>
<p>
    As I moved from physics to biology and now into machine learning, my worldview has shifted from one focused on material reality to one that deals largely with abstractions of information.  I've thought a great deal about these two viewpoints and wondered about their relationship. Importantly, as I've interacted with people ensconced in these two fields, I've noticed a tangible difference between these two distinctive models of thought.
</p>
<p>
    It appears to me that scientifically and rationally intelligent individuals unwittingly bias their discourses entirely on the presupposition of the preeminence of one or the other view of the fundamental depiction of the space that our identities inhabit. To put a finer point on the issue, I'll name and describe these two spaces based on two pairs of philosophers and scientist who I most closely identify with each.
</p>
<pre>
    Aristotelian/Feynmanian space - A standard physical universe
    Reality is physical,
    there is no fundamental space that unify ideas outside of our discourse
    our useful efforts lie in efficiently cataloging the physical by the discussion of observations of phenomena.
</pre>
<pre>
    Platonic/Einsteinian space - A space of purified ideas
    Reality is the ideals we uncover,
    the particular details of the different manifestations of these ideals are largely unimportant
    our useful efforts lie in properly mapping specific phenomena back into the psace of ideals where their fundamental principles are truly defined
</pre>

<p>
    In this way we can think of the material view focusing on conventional spacetime as the space that existing entities truly occupy. Meanwhile, the idealistic view defines the space of ideas as the space that existing entities truly occupy.
</p>

<p>
    I've thought a lot about the relation between our material universe and the idealistic universe, and I've decided that the very thing that makes our universe an interesting one to inhabit is that the two spaces coexist and are intermingled. In fact, my intuition about the validity of my consciousness is predicated on the comingling of these two spaces.
</p>

<p>
    To describe this third "necessary combination" view that I've developed to frame my mental model of the universe, I've had to develop what I believe to be a new description of the way that entities exist in this third space interpretation of the universe.  I've called this new construct an "identifield," and I'd like to take the rest of this blog post to describe the idea.
</p>

<h3>What is an identifield?</h3>
<p>
    Identifield is a shorthand term for an<strong>information identity spacetime field</strong>. It is a means for articulating how a thing of information (ie platonic ideal) exists in the material world (ie in physical reality).  To look at an identifield is to look at how an idea fits into the evolution of all ideas spread across physical time and space.  That sounds a little extravagant, but once it's broken down, I think it isn't totally crazy.
</p>

<h3>Explained By example</h3>
<p>
    It might help to take a simple example where we are looking at the information contained in a single paragraph in a book.  We would start by asking, "Does the information live just in the printed words of a single page?"  No, at the very least it has to be present in all the printed copies of that book. But the information can be thought to exist in a whole lot of other places too.
</p>
<p>
    Imagine that paragraph contains the quote "Call me Ishmael" from Moby Dick. That would mean some of the information lives in a small part of all the copies of Moby Dick as well.  And suppose that when the author quoted that line in Moby Dick, she did so because she had also read an article that suggested quoting Moby Dick is a good strategy for getting published. So some seed of the generation of the paragraph was formed in that article too. All the places where the author gathered information to write that paragraph include some partial component of the information contained within it.
</p>
<p>
    And that isn't the end of it either. It's also present in the minds of anyone who might read the paragraph and internalize that information.  How much of the information is present will vary depending on how much attention the audience was paying, and whether they correctly translated the information into their own brains.  Finally, the information in that paragraph may someday be referenced in another novel, which can lead to diffusion to a whole other set of people.
</p>
<p>
    So if you were to try to imagine where that information lives at all times and how "strong" of a residue of the information is present, you'd have to picture a 4D spacetime field occupying all the places we just mentioned.  That's an identifield.
</p>

<h3>Explained in greater detail</h3>
<p>
    If the craziness above wasn't enough for you, here's a little more explanation.  Lets break down the defintion of identifield, <strong>information identity spacetime field</strong>.
</p>
<h5>Information Identity</h5>
<p>
    To start, I should explain what I mean by an <em>information identity</em>.  I'm using the term to mean, literally, the identity that defines some information, but to understand that we need to break down what I mean by information and identity.</p>
<p>
    Even though information is a fairly abstract concept, I think most people seem to have a pretty intuitive sense of what it is.  To cut to the chase, let's just say information is some way of describing ideas that we can transmit around through physical manifestations.  Similarly, I like to use a definition of identity that hybridizes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy)">philosophical definition</a> with our more intuitive understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)">personal identity</a>. So for the sake of this discussion let's just say that identity is the combination of all those aspects of a thing that make it that unique thing in and of itself.  So your jacket's identity is all the things that make your jacket, your jacket and not somebody else's.
</p>
<p>
    The information identity is then just the way of defining a unique piece of information.  It's important to remember that unlike the identity of jackets and people, information is not the medium itself, but rather the meaning conveyed on the medium.  This means that information can be replicated exactly, and so the information identity can be shared among many different conduits of information all over the world.
</p>

<h5>Spacetime</h5>
<p>
    To picture an information identity as it exists in the world, we'd need to mentally visualize the locations of all the copies of that information in the world.  If we were imagining the information in a news article we would imagine all the open web browsers that are viewing that article and all the copies sitting on computer servers.  Next, we'd further imagine the location in each person's mind where they are storing the information that they have just read. And if they communicate the story verbally, the information is contained in the waves of air particles propagating from their mouths.
</p>
<p>
    All of this is overwhelming to picture in the moment because there are some people navigating to and from the page, reading, forgetting, and discussing, off and on all the time.  For me, it helps to broaden our imagination of information existing in all points in space and take it one step further. We imagine not just where that information is at this instant, but where it has been at all points in time.
</p>
<p>
    To imagine this, we turn to a concept from physics called spacetime.  If you are unfamiliar with the idea of spacetime, I .  But for those who are familiar with the concept, you will recall that spacetime allow us to project a single physical object, like a bowling ball, simultaneously existing at all point in space that it will ever occupy.  This turns compact objects into extruded such as the one in this illustration.
</p>
<img src="/assets/images/main/bowlingslice_stack.png" alt="bowling ball rolling slices" />
<p>
    This is the same situation for the information identities described above.  However, the information identity isn't relegated to a single tube like the bowling ball because the information identity may exist in many, far-reaching locations at once. We can think about what happens when we start replicating information.  For example, imagine my friend wants to come over and copy a flash drive.  Well if you looked at some information identity housed on that flashdrive in spacetime, you'd see it would look like a single tube at early times (like the bowling ball) and then suddenly it would split to become two tubes that snake around independently.
</p>
<p>
    There are several interesting corellaries that I'll cover below. But to begin, let's ask, what happens if something goes wrong when we copy the flash drive and some small difference appears.  Are they two totally different information identities now?  How do we deal with that?
</p>
<h5>Field</h5>
<p>
    The final piece of the identifield is allowing the information identity to exist in a continuous state rather than as something fully binary. We want the "presence" of the information to vary continuously from 100% when you have an exact copy to 0% when you have something that is totally unrelated.  To describe this we turn to another physics concept called a <em>field</em>.
</p>
<p>
    We're mostly familiar with fields in physics like gravitational force fields and elecromagnetic fields.  But any quantity that varies in space can be described as a field.  We can talk about the temperature field to describe how temperature varies throughout a house (warmer by the sunny windows, colder in the basement). We can even talk about more abstract things like an "intelligence field that quantifies how intelligent the entities in one region of space are.  For an intelligence field, parts of the world occupied by humans have a high value, parts occupied by slugs have a lower value (presumably) and rocks would have even lower value.
</p>
<p>
    We're interested in the information identity spacetime field, which we can define as how much of the information identity is present across different points in space and time.  This accounts for minor corruptions in the information as well as intentional changes to the inderlying information. Importantly, when your identifiable unit of information is first "formed," it is often constructed by some restructuring of multiple previously existing pieces of information. This means that going back prior to its formation, you would see partial remnants of the information identity in any preceding ideas that might have been important. Furthermore, other pieces of information may be derived from your information identity but are combined with other information.
</p>
<p>
    Once you begin to imagine information identities existing in 4D spacetime, it's hard not to start thinking of the whole world in terms of this construct.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    Well, the point is that there is no conclusion.  This site is my best attempt to catalog the identifield of all the (useful) information contained in Will Stedden. This particular identifield, is what I've called the bonkerfield.  If you take the information identity on this site with you and it informs your life, then you become a part of its identifield.  And bonkerfield becomes a part of you.

<h4>Appendix: Spacetime Explained</h4>
<p>
    It can be tricky to think about where something is in not only space, but time too.  Physicists picture the location of objects in space and time using a concept called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime">spacetime</a>.  They generally think about this in regard to physical objects, and that's a good place to get an introduction to the concept.  As an example, check out this bowling ball rolling in this gif I found.
</p>
<img src="/assets/images/main/bowlingball.gif" alt="bowling ball rolling" />
<p>
    The ball is more or less traveling in a straight line down the alley so at any point in time we can describe its position along the single spatial dimension of the length of the alley.  We can view the position along that dimension of space at multiple time points by looking at still frames from the movie next to each other.
</p>
<img src="/assets/images/main/bowlingslice.png" alt="bowling ball rolling slices" />
<p>
    Now if we were to narrow the slices and take more of them, the path of the ball would become filled in along that single dimension.  We can draw this out as a filled in tube in a 2D plane.
</p>

<p>
    This is two dimensions of the spacetime that the bowling ball occupies (one spatial dimension and one time dimension).  If you think beyond the timeframe in the video, you can imagine the bowling ball going on to be used over and over again.  The full spacetime location of the bowling ball is the path traced out by it through its entire existence.
