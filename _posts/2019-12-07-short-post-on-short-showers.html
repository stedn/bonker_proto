    I finally was able to reduce my flying this year to just two flights to visit family for the holidays. My partner still points out that I take long showers so I should get off my high horse. I've decided to fix that.
</p>
<h4>A little math</h4>
<p>
    I found <a href="http://greenblizzard.com/2016/05/09/showers-and-co2/">several</a> <a href="https://theecoguide.org/have-you-tried-five-minute-shower-challenge">calculations</a> of the amount of carbon dioxide produced by a shower. This varies by energy source so I tried a quick calculation for my own residence.
</p>
<p>
    Assuming 2.5 gallons/minute of shower, and that I'm heating the water by about 60 degrees, we can use <a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/egee102/node/2003">this equation</a> to calculate the power needed.
</p>
<blockquote>2.5 gallon/minute x 8 lbs/gallon x 1 BTU/lbºF x 60ºF = <strong>1200 BTU/minute</strong> </blockquote>
<p>
    I heat it using electricity,and it seems that electric water heaters are generally considered to be around <a href="https://smarterhouse.org/water-heating/replacing-your-water-heater">90% efficient</a>. So I'm actually using 1200/0.9 = <strong>1333 BTU/minute</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    California's PG&amp;E power mix says it is only <a href="https://www.pge.com/pge_global/common/pdfs/your-account/your-bill/understand-your-bill/bill-inserts/2019/1019-Power-Content-Label.pdf">15% fossil fuel</a> (probably mostly natural gas). According to the US EIA, natural gas releases <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_a_03.html">~50 kg of CO2 for every million BTU</a> or equivalently 0.05 g/BTU. So at this point it seems every minute of shower is 1333 BTU/minute * 0.15 * 0.05 gCO2/BTU = <strong>9 gCO2/minute</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    For perspective, I used <a href="https://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=3">this online flight carbon calculator</a> to calculate that I released 0.29 metric tons of carbon (or 290000 grams) to visit my family in Tuscon this Thanksgiving. So that one trip was equivalent to showering for 22 days straight.
</p>
<h4>Shortening my showers</h4>
<p>
    So showers are a drop in the bucket (pun intended) compared to flights, but I still figured I could make a change. I take about a 12 minute shower every day. I figured I could drop that to 2 minutes if I try. That 10 minutes would save 90 grams of CO2 a day, and if I could keep it up for a year, that'd be about 32kg. That's equivalent to an 80 mile car ride. But no one will ride in the car with me because I'd be smelly.
</p>
<p>
    Anyway, I'll be setting a timer to try to get down to 2 minutes by January 1, and after I'll see if I can go the whole year. Please leave a comment if you see something off in my calculations.
