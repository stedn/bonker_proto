        This is just a short post about a hallway wall decoration I made over the weekend. It's supposed to resemble a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory">network graph</a>, linking the different pieces together.

        Basically I had a lot of unrelated stuff to put on our last empty wall and I needed a clever way to get it all on there. I hope you find it as amusing as I do.
