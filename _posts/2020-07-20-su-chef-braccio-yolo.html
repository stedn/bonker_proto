    In my previous post, I described my idea to start a worker-owned automation company by building a automated robotic food truck. I've started designing the interior of the truck and simulating it, but before I finish that, I wanted to get some experience working with a functional robotics tech stack.
</p>

<p>
    After consulting with my friend who is getting his PhD in robotics, he suggested I get my feet wet while solving a subtask by building a sous-chef. I thought that was perfect! But it's not <strong>sous</strong> (meaning under in french), it's <strong>su</strong> (meaning substitute user in Unix-speak).
</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<p>
    Thanks to the amazing open source ROS and Arduino communities, it took me a little over a week to go from just parts and an idea to this functioning prototype.

<p>
    In the rest of this post I'll break down how the project works at a high level. But if you want to build it yourself and see how to run it, you can go straight to the README.md instructions in my <a href="https://github.com/lots-of-things/ros_braccio_opencv_obj_detect_grab">source repository</a>.
